# Calories Deficit Planner(Cs-157A-Project)
This project is designed to help users make informed dietary decisions by providing essential macronutrient data through a search feature integrated with the USDA Food API. By inputting personal information such as height, weight, and activity level, users receive a tailored calorie recommendation based on one of our preset nutrition plans.
